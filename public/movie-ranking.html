        <h3>Shrek 2</h3>
        <p>
        Really Funny!<br />
        Full of references for daily use:)<br />
        From Puss in Boots' sass to Fiona's independence, it's a fairy tale parody that never gets old, making it an all-time favorite for me.<br />        
        </p>

        <h3>Mamma Mia</h3>
        <p>
        Absolute Classic for any musical lover!<br />
        "It's an adventure Harry, It's good for you." :D<br />        
        </p>

        <h3>Top Gun 1 & 2</h3>
        <p>
        Absolute Classic in  general!<br />
        Everything about this is stunning. The music, the acting, the cinematography and the action.<br />        
        </p>

        <h3>Alice in Wonderland (Live Actions of course)</h3>
        <p>
        Aesthetically pleasing films but they are a bit dark in terms of colour.<br />
        Makes me feel like a child, and taught me to believe in impossible things.<br />        
        </p>

        <h3>The Proposal</h3>
        <p>
        Funniest Romance out there Hands Down!<br />
        Who doesn't love Ryan Reynolds?<br />
        Their playful banter and genuine connection make the film a joy to watch. Its charming blend of humor and heart makes it a standout favorite in the rom-com genre.<br />
        </p>

        <h3>Just Go With It</h3>
        <p>
        Such good comedy bits.<br />
        A lot of adult humor ;)<br />   
        While predictable, its blend of humor and warmth makes it an enjoyable watch for fans of feel-good films like me.<br />      
        </p>

        <h3>Scent of a Woman</h3>
        <p>
        Brilliant Movie.<br />
        It was a masterfully acted drama featuring a powerhouse performance by Al Pacino, whose portrayal of a blind, cantankerous ex-Army officer is both riveting and deeply moving. The film beautifully balances intense emotional moments with a touching narrative about redemption and the power of human connection.<br />
